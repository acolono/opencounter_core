Feature: read one counter
As an apiuser
in order to /display the counter value
i need to be able to /get the counter value/ from api


GET /counters/1/value
  Scenario: Getting the value for a single counter in the collection
    Given a counter "onecounter" with a value of "1" has been set
    When I get the value of the counter with name "onecounter"
    Then the value returned should be 1
